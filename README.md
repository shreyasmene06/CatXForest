## üåü Overview

Live at: [catxforest.onrender.com](https://catxforest.onrender.com/)

**CatXForest** is a machine learning-powered web application that provides personalized career recommendations for students. By analyzing academic scores across multiple subjects, extracurricular activities, and other key attributes, the system predicts the top 5 most suitable career paths with confidence probabilities.

### üéØ Problem Statement

Students often struggle to identify career paths that align with their strengths and interests. This system uses advanced machine learning to analyze student data and provide data-driven career recommendations.

### üí° Solution

A hybrid ensemble model (Stacking Classifier) combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost algorithms achieves **84.97% accuracy** in predicting suitable careers from 17 different career categories.

- **Input Features** (14 total):
  - Gender (encoded)
  - Part-time job status (binary)
  - Absence days (numeric)
  - Extracurricular activities (binary)
  - Weekly self-study hours (numeric)
  - Subject scores (7 subjects)
  - Total score (engineered)
  - Average score (engineered)

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Label encoding for categorical variables
  - Standard scaling for numerical features
  - SMOTE for class imbalance handling

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### One-Command Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyasmene06/CatXForest.git
cd CatXForest
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

---

## üì• Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyasmene06/CatXForest.git
cd CatXForest
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import flask, sklearn, numpy; print('All dependencies installed successfully!')"
```

---

## üß† Model Training

The pre-trained models are included in the `Models/` directory. To retrain the model from scratch:

### Step 1: Download Dataset

Download the student dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noorsaeed/student-studeis-recommendation) and place `student-scores.csv` in the project root.

### Step 2: Run Training Notebook

Open and run `Studies Recommendations.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Studies Recommendations.ipynb"
```

Or use JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab "Studies Recommendations.ipynb"
```

### Step 3: Training Process

The notebook will:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Create engineered features (total_score, average_score)
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Balance the dataset using SMOTE
5. Train multiple models and compare performance
6. Create a hybrid ensemble (Stacking Classifier)
7. Save the best model to `Models/` directory

### Generated Files

After training, the following files are created:

- `Models/model.pkl` - Random Forest model (83% accuracy)
- `Models/hybrid_model.pkl` - Stacking ensemble (84.97% accuracy)
- `Models/scaler.pkl` - StandardScaler for feature normalization
- `Models/model_info.pkl` - Model metadata and performance metrics

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The application uses `model.pkl` by default. To use the hybrid model, update line 14 in `app.py` to load `hybrid_model.pkl`.
